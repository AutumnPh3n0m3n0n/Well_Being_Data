##Transforming the data


1) Tables were cleaned so they would be concise.
    *Clean_Happiness, which has Country Name and Happiness Rank.
    *Clean_GDP, which has the Country Name and Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
    *Clean_Inflation, which has the Country Name and Inflation Rate
    *Clean_Savings, which has the Country Name and the Savings Rate

2) The cleaned tables were converted into dataframes

3) The dataframes were joined into one large table, **World_Well_Being**, through multiple left outer joins.
    
4) The World_Well_Being table is exported into a csv file.
